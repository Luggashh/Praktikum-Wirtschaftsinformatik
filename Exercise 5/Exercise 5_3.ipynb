First, the airline or airport staff checks the baggage for compliance regarding amount, weight, and dimensions. If the baggage is not compliant, the passenger is required to pay a fee via credit card. Subsequently, prohibited items such as valuables and batteries must be removed, and the baggage is transported in the aircraft hold. The passenger proceeds to Boarding and enters the cabin. The Flight is ready for departure. If the baggage is compliant, the process checks for high flight occupancy. If occupancy is high, the staff offers a free check-in option for the compliant baggage. The passenger can then decide whether to accept this offer. If accepted, the baggage is prepared for the hold after removing sensitive items. If the offer is declined, or if the flight occupancy is normal, the passenger proceeds to boarding and enters the cabin. Inside the cabin, the stowage method depends on the item size. Large items are stowed in the overhead bins, while smaller personal items are placed under the seat in front. The process ends when the passenger is seated and ready for departure.</bpmn:documentation>\n",
